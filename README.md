# üõ°Ô∏è Risk Assessment Scenario Task: Medicare-Clinic

**Scenario: Risk Assessment for "MediCare Clinic"**

MediCare Clinic is a small healthcare practice with 10 employees, including doctors, nurses, and an office administrator. They store patient records in a cloud-based Electronic Health Records (EHR) system and use an in-office Wi-Fi network. Employees use desktops and mobile devices to access patient information.

Task:
-Identify, evaluate, and document potential risks for MediCare Clinic, following these steps:

-Create an asset inventory (List key assets such as EHR software, office Wi-Fi, employee devices, etc.).

-Identify potential threats (Think of cyber and physical threats like ransomware, unauthorized access, or insider threats).

-Rate the risk (Use High, Medium, or Low based on impact and likelihood).

-Suggest risk mitigation strategies (How can the clinic reduce these risks? Think of security controls like encryption, MFA, security awareness training, etc.).
